## About
<img src="Resources/Logo.svg" align="left" width="78px"/>
This is yet another free and open-source player framework for the 
Unity game engine. It is targeted towards both 
professionals and hobbyists, with ease of use and modularity in mind. 
This repository contains a sample Unity project, with pre-made layers,
tags, and prefabs. You can merge the provided project with your own, or
alternatively you can import one of the <code>.unitypackage</code> files.
